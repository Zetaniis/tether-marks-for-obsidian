// Remove this file or refactor it to match the new plugin structure.
// The main plugin logic is now in main.ts, and marks are managed as Mark[] not Record<string, string>.
// If you want to keep this file, you must:
// - Import MarkListModal from the correct path
// - Use Mark[] for marks, not Record<string, string>
// - Use saveMarks, not saveMark
// - Remove or update this class to not conflict with VimMarksImpl in main.ts

// For now, this file is obsolete and should be deleted or refactored if you want a second plugin class.
